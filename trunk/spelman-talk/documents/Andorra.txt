    [edit </w/index.php?title=Andorra&action=edit&section=1>] Origin and
    history of the name

The name "Andorra" is of unknown origin but, according to Joan Coromines
</wiki/Joan_Coromines>, pre-Roman.^[/citation needed
</wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] The name Andorra may be derived from
al-Darra (الدّارة), the Arabic word for forest.^[/citation needed
</wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] Many of the local toponyms
</wiki/Toponyms> are of Iberian </wiki/Iberian_language> origin.


    [edit </w/index.php?title=Andorra&action=edit&section=2>] History

    /Main article: History of Andorra </wiki/History_of_Andorra>/

Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne </wiki/Charlemagne>)
granted a charter </wiki/Charter> to the Andorran people in return for
fighting against the Moors </wiki/Moors>. Overlordship </wiki/Overlord>
of the territory was of the local count of Urgell
</wiki/Count_of_Urgell> and eventually to the bishop </wiki/Bishop> of
the diocese </wiki/Diocese> of Urgell </wiki/Urgell>. In 988 </wiki/988>
Borrell II count of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of
Urgell </wiki/Diocese_of_Urgell> when the count expanded to the
south^[2] <#cite_note-histo1-1> . Since then the Bishop of Urgell
</wiki/Urgell>, locally known as the bishop of the la Seu d'Urgell
</wiki/La_Seu_d%27Urgell>, has owned Andorra^[3] <#cite_note-elements-2> .

Andorra hadn't any type of protection and the Bishop of Urgell, who knew
that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys^[3]
<#cite_note-elements-2> , decided to ask for help and protection from
the Lord of Caboet. In 1095 </wiki/1095>, the Lord of Caboet and the
Bishop of la Seu d'Urgell signed under oath the recognition of their
sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married
the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and
Cerdanya. Years later their daughter, Ermessenda^[4] <#cite_note-3> ,
married Roger Bernat II of the French </wiki/French> Count of Foix
</wiki/Count_of_Foix>. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I
Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya and also sovereigns
of Andorra (shared with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the eleventh century a dispute arose between the bishop of la Seu
d'Urgell </wiki/La_Seu_d%27Urgell> and Count of Foix. The conflict was
resolved in 1278 </wiki/1278> by the signing of the first paréage
</wiki/Par%C3%A9age>, with the mediation of Aragon </wiki/Aragon>, which
provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix
</wiki/Count_of_Foix>^[3] <#cite_note-elements-2> (whose title would
ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of
Urgell </wiki/Urgell>, in Catalonia </wiki/Catalonia>. This gave the
small principality </wiki/Principality> its territory and political form.

Over the years the title passed to the kings of Navarre </wiki/Navarre>,
and after Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France
</wiki/Henry_IV_of_France> he issued an edict (1607) that established
the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of
Andorra.

In the period 1812–13, the First French Empire
</wiki/First_French_Empire> annexed Catalonia </wiki/Catalonia> and
divided it in four départements </wiki/D%C3%A9partement>. Andorra was
also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà
</wiki/Puigcerd%C3%A0> (département of Sègre </wiki/S%C3%A8gre>).

Andorra declared war on Imperial Germany </wiki/Imperial_Germany> during
World War I </wiki/World_War_I> but did not actually take part in the
fighting. It remained in an official state of belligerency
</wiki/Belligerency> until 1957 as it was not included in the Versailles
Peace Treaty </wiki/Versailles_Peace_Treaty>.

In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before
elections. On July 12, 1934, an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff
</wiki/Boris_Skossyreff> issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring
himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring
war on the bishop of Urgell. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on
July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French
detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the
Spanish Civil War </wiki/Spanish_Civil_War> and Franco's Spain
</wiki/Franco%27s_Spain>. Francoist troops reached the Andorran border
in the later stages of the war.

During World War II </wiki/World_War_II>, Andorra remained neutral and
was an important smuggling route between Vichy France
</wiki/Vichy_France> and Spain.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream
of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and
Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist </wiki/Tourism>
industry along with developments in transportation and communications
have removed the country from its isolation. Its political system was
thoroughly modernized in 1993, the year in which it became a member of
the United Nations </wiki/United_Nations> and the Council of Europe
</wiki/Council_of_Europe>.


    [edit </w/index.php?title=Andorra&action=edit&section=3>] Politics

    /Main article: Politics of Andorra </wiki/Politics_of_Andorra>/

Andorra is a co-principality </wiki/Co-principality> with the President

Urgell </wiki/Bishop_of_Urgell>, Spain </wiki/Spain>, as co-princes
</wiki/List_of_Co-Princes_of_Andorra>, in a duumvirate
</wiki/Duumvirate>. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of
a parliamentary </wiki/Parliamentary_system> representative democracy
</wiki/Representative_democracy>, whereby the Prime Minister of Andorra
</wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Andorra> is the head of government
</wiki/Head_of_government>, and of a pluriform
<http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pluriform> multi-party system. Executive
power </wiki/Executive_power> is exercised by the government.
Legislative power </wiki/Legislative_power> is vested in both the
government </wiki/Government> and parliament. The Judiciary
</wiki/Judiciary> is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The current Prime Minister is Albert Pintat Santolaria
</wiki/Albert_Pintat_Santolaria> of the Andorran Liberal Party (PLA).

Responsibility for defending Andorra rests with Spain and France.
Andorra currently has no military force

</wiki/Image:97183442_f55d8aa568_b.jpg>
Scenery of the Andorran mountains.

Due to its location in the eastern Pyrenees </wiki/Pyrenees> mountain
range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains of an average
height of 1,996 metres (6,549 ft) with the highest being the Coma
Pedrosa </wiki/Coma_Pedrosa> at 2,946 metres (9,665 ft). These are
dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as
the main stream, the Valira </wiki/Valira> river, leaves the country for
Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of 870 m/2,854 ft). Andorra's surface
area is 468 square kilometres (181 sq mi).

Andorra's climate </wiki/Climate> is similar to that of its neighbours'
temperate climates </wiki/Temperate_climate>, but its higher altitude
means there is, on average, more snow in winter and it is slightly
cooler in summer.

Phytogeographically </wiki/Phytogeography>, Andorra belongs to the
Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region
</wiki/Circumboreal_Region> within the Boreal Kingdom
</wiki/Boreal_Kingdom>. According to the WWF
</wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature>, the territory of Andorra belongs to
the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests
</w/index.php?title=Pyrenees_conifer_and_mixed_forests&action=edit&redlink=1>.

Tourism </wiki/Tourism>, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do
economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP </wiki/Gross_Domestic_Product>.
An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's
duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts </wiki/Resort>.
Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of
adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader
availability of goods and lower tariffs </wiki/Tariff>.

The banking </wiki/Banking> sector, with its tax haven </wiki/Tax_haven>
status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural
</wiki/Agriculture> production is limited—only 2% of the land is
arable—and most food </wiki/Food> has to be imported
</wiki/International_trade>. Some tobacco is grown locally. The
principal livestock activity is domestic sheep </wiki/Domestic_sheep>
raising. Manufacturing </wiki/Manufacturing> output consists mainly of
cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources
</wiki/Natural_resources> include hydroelectric power
</wiki/Hydroelectric_power>, mineral water </wiki/Mineral_water>, timber
</wiki/Timber>, iron ore </wiki/Iron_ore>, and lead </wiki/Lead>.^[5]
<#cite_note-cia-4>

Andorra is not a full member </wiki/European_Union_member_state> of the
European Union </wiki/European_Union>, but enjoys a special relationship
</wiki/Microstates_and_the_European_Union> with it, such as being
treated as an EU </wiki/European_Union> member for trade in manufactured
goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.
Andorra lacks a currency </wiki/Currency> of its own and uses that of
its two surrounding nations. Prior to 1999 these were the French franc
</wiki/French_franc> and the Spanish peseta </wiki/Peseta>, which have
since been both replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro
</wiki/Euro>. Andorra is negotiating to issue its own euro coins.


    [edit </w/index.php?title=Andorra&action=edit&section=7>] Demographics

    /Main article: Demographics of Andorra </wiki/Demographics_of_Andorra>/

Andorrans are a minority in their own country; Spaniards </wiki/Spain>,
Portuguese </wiki/Portuguese_People>, French </wiki/France>, Britons
</wiki/United_Kingdom>, and Italians </wiki/Italian_people> resident in
Andorra make up 67.7% of the population. According to the U.S. Census
Bureau, Andorra has the world's longest life expectancy: 83.5 years.


      [edit </w/index.php?title=Andorra&action=edit&section=8>] Languages

    /Main article: Languages of Andorra </wiki/Languages_of_Andorra>/

The national language is Catalan </wiki/Catalan_language>, a Romance
language </wiki/Romance_language>. Andorra is one of only four nations
(together with France, Monaco, and Turkey) that never signed the Council
of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities
</wiki/Framework_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_National_Minorities>.^[6]

    /Main article: Culture of Andorra </wiki/Culture_of_Andorra>/

The official and historic language is Catalan </wiki/Catalan_language>.
Because of immigration, historical links, and close geographic
proximity, other languages such as Spanish </wiki/Spanish_language> and
French </wiki/French_language> are also commonly spoken.

Andorra's long history </wiki/History_of_Andorra> has provided it with a
rich folklore </wiki/Folklore> and an abundance of folk tales
</wiki/Folk_tale>, with roots originating as far as Andalusia
</wiki/Andalusia> in the south and the Netherlands </wiki/Netherlands>
in the north.^[/citation needed </wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

Andorran culture is Catalan in essence. In significant and easily
identifiable ways it has contributed to the conglomerate of Catalan
culture.^[/citation needed </wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

Two writers renowned in Catalonia and the region, Michèle Gazier
</w/index.php?title=Mich%C3%A8le_Gazier&action=edit&redlink=1> and Ramon
Villeró </w/index.php?title=Ramon_Viller%C3%B3&action=edit&redlink=1>,
both come from Andorra.^[/citation needed
</wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs
</w/index.php?title=Contrap%C3%A0s&action=edit&redlink=1> and marratxa
</w/index.php?title=Marratxa&action=edit&redlink=1>, which survive in
Sant Julià de Lòria </wiki/Sant_Juli%C3%A0_de_L%C3%B2ria> especially.
Andorran folk music has similarities to the music of its neighbors, but
is especially Catalan </wiki/Music_of_Catalonia> in character,
especially in the presence of dances such as the sardana
</wiki/Sardana>. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs
</w/index.php?title=Contrap%C3%A0s&action=edit&redlink=1> in Andorra la
Vella </wiki/Andorra_la_Vella> and Saint Anne's dance
</w/index.php?title=Saint_Anne%27s_dance&action=edit&redlink=1> in
Escaldes-Engordany </wiki/Escaldes-Engordany>.

Andorra's national holiday </wiki/National_day> is Our Lady of Meritxell
</wiki/Our_Lady_of_Meritxell> Day, September 8.^[5] <#cite_note-cia-4>
