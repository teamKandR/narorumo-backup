    History

*Spelman's History at a glance* 1881 	Established as Atlanta Baptist
Female Seminary
1884 	Name changed to Spelman Seminary
1901 	The first college degrees were awarded
1924 	Becomes Spelman College

The /Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary/ was established on April 11,
1881 (1881-04-11) in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church in
Atlanta, Georgia, by two teachers from the Oread Institute
</wiki/Oread_Institute> of Worcester, Massachusetts
</wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts>: Harriet E. Giles and Sophia B. Packard
</wiki/Sophia_B._Packard>.^[1] <#cite_note-NewGA-0> The school was
originally named Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary.

Giles and Packard began the school with 11 African-American women and
$100 given to them by a church congregation in Medford, Massachusetts
</wiki/Medford,_Massachusetts>.^[1] <#cite_note-NewGA-0> In 1882 the two
women returned to Massachusetts to bid for more money and were
introduced to wealthy businessman John D. Rockefeller
</wiki/John_D._Rockefeller> at a church conference in Ohio.^[1]
<#cite_note-NewGA-0>

In 1883, the school relocated to a nine acre (36,000 m²) site in Atlanta
relatively close to the church they began in, which originally had only
five buildings to support classroom and residence hall needs. The school
was able to survive on generous donations by the black community in
Atlanta, the efforts of volunteer teachers, and gifts of supplies.

Spelman presidents [show] <javascript:toggleNavigationBar(1);>

Since its inception Spelman has had nine presidents:

    * Sophia B. Packard,
    * Harriet E. Giles, under whom the school gained a charter and
      granted its first college degrees
    * Lucy Hale Tapley, under whom the school decided to focus on higher
      education, the school officially became Spelman College (1927),
      and Sisters Chapel, one of the main buildings on campus, was erected.
    * Florence M. Read </wiki/Florence_M._Read>, a Mount Holyoke College
      </wiki/Mount_Holyoke_College> graduate, under whom the school
      established an endowment fund of over $3 million, the school came
      into agreement with Atlanta University and Morehouse College to
      form the Atlanta University Center
      </wiki/Atlanta_University_Center> (later Clark-Atlanta University,
      Morris Brown College, Morehouse School of Medicine, and the
      Interdenominational Theological Center were added), the Arnett
      Library was built, and Spelman earned approval from the American
      Association of Universities;
    * Dr. Albert E. Manley (the first black and first male president of
      Spelman), under whom study abroad programs were established, the
      fine arts center was built, and three new residence halls and
      several classroom buildings were renovated. According to Howard
      Zinn </wiki/Howard_Zinn>, Manley tried to suppress the student
      civil rights movement that was taking place on campus during his
      tenure.
    * Dr. Donald M. Stewart, under which the departments of women's
      studies and chemistry were founded, and three strategic programs
      were formed: the Comprehensive Writing Program, the Women's
      Research and Resource Center, and the Ethel Waddell Githii Honors
      Program, and a continuing education department and a computer
      literacy program were established;
    * Dr. Johnnetta B. Cole </wiki/Johnnetta_B._Cole> (the first African
      American </wiki/African_American> female president of Spelman),
      under whom the college received $20 million from Drs. William and
      Camille Cosby for the construction of the Cosby Academic Center
      and instituted the Cole Institute for Community Service;
    * Dr. Audrey F. Manley </wiki/Audrey_F._Manley> (the first alumna
      president of Spelman), under which Spelman gained a Phi Beta Kappa
      </wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa> chapter, Spelman was accepted as a
      provisional member of NCAA Division III athletics, a Science
      Center was finished;
    * Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum </wiki/Beverly_Daniel_Tatum>, who was
      appointed in 2002 after teaching for a number of years at Mount
      Holyoke College, and under whom the renovation of Sisters Chapel
      was begun

In April 1884, Rockefeller visited the school and decided that he liked
what he saw, so he settled the debt on the property. The name of the
school was changed to the /Spelman Seminary/ after Laura Spelman
</wiki/Laura_Spelman>, an Oread student and wife of John D. Rockefeller
</wiki/John_Rockefeller>^[1] <#cite_note-NewGA-0> who helped to fund the
school and her parents, who were longtime anti-slavery activists.in
honor of Rockefeller's in-laws the Spelmans, longtime activists in the
anti-slavery movement. Rockefeller's gift precipitated a flurry of
interest from other benefactors, and their investements allowed the
school to flourish.

Spelman College in popular culture [show]
<javascript:toggleNavigationBar(2);>

/"A Different World </wiki/A_Different_World_(TV_series)>"/

According to the /Museum of Broadcast Communications/, when Debbie Allen
</wiki/Debbie_Allen> became the director-producer of Bill Cosby
</wiki/Bill_Cosby>'s NBC </wiki/NBC> television show, /A Different World
</wiki/A_Different_World_(TV_series)>/ (which ran for six seasons and
dealt with the life of students at the fictional historically Black
college </wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities>, Hillman
College) she drew from her college experiences in an effort to
accurately reflect in the show the social and political life on black
campuses. Allen, "a graduate of historically black Howard University
</wiki/Howard_University>, instituted a yearly spring trip to Atlanta
where series writers visited two of the nation's leading black colleges,
Morehouse </wiki/Morehouse_College> and Spelman. During these visits,
ideas for several of the episodes emerged from meetings with students
and faculty."^[5] <#cite_note-4>

/"The Oprah Winfrey Show </wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show>"/

Oprah Winfrey </wiki/Oprah_Winfrey> included a panel of seven women from
Spelman College via satellite on her Hip Hop Town Hall show. They had
previously protested a scheduled performance by rapper Nelly
</wiki/Nelly> at their school. At the time, students said they were
upset at how the women were portrayed in his 2003 video "Tip Drill
</wiki/Tip_Drill>". Special guests on-stage included Russell Simmons
</wiki/Russell_Simmons>, conscientious rapper Common
</wiki/Common_(rapper)>, Dr. Benjamin Chavis </wiki/Benjamin_Chavis> of
Simmon's Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, and Kevin Liles, executive vice
president at Warner Music </wiki/Warner_Music>. Seated in the audience
were Stanley Crouch </wiki/Stanley_Crouch> of the New York Daily News
</wiki/New_York_Daily_News> and Bruce Gordon </wiki/Bruce_Gordon> of CBS
</wiki/CBS>, former NAACP </wiki/NAACP> head.^[/citation needed
</wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

/ATL </wiki/ATL_(film)>/

In the movie ATL </wiki/ATL_(film)> Lauren London's character, New
New/Erin, wanted to attend Spelman College instead of her father's
choice, Brinton. Later in the end of the movie it shows her attending
Spelman with her dad helping her move into her dorm.^[/citation needed
</wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

Rockefeller also donated the funds for what is currently the oldest
building on campus, Rockefeller Hall; in 1887 Packard Hall was also
established. Packard was appointed as Spelman's first president in 1888,
after the charter for the seminary was granted. The first college
degrees were awarded in 1901.

Packard died in 1891, and Giles assumed the presidency until her death
in 1909.^[6] <#cite_note-SChistory-5> Lucy Hale Tapley then became
president, and the college witnessed a transition to vocational
training. Tapley declared: "Any course of study which fails to cultivate
a taste and fitness for practical and efficient work in some part of the
field of the world’s needs is unpopular at Spelman and finds no place in
our curriculum." ^[6] <#cite_note-SChistory-5> The nursing curriculum
was strengthened; a teachers' dormitory and a home economics building
were constructed, and Tapley Hall, the science building, was completed
in 1925. ^[6] <#cite_note-SChistory-5> A club for students whose mothers
and aunts had attended Spelman was also created, and this club is still
in existence today.

In 1924, Spelman Seminary became /Spelman College/. Spelman also
solidified its affiliation with Morehouse College
</wiki/Morehouse_College> and Atlanta University
</wiki/Clark_Atlanta_University> by chartering the Atlanta University
Center in 1929. Atlanta University was to provide graduate education for
students, whereas Morehouse and Spelman were responsible for the
undergraduate education. In 1932, Spelman was granted accreditation
</wiki/Accreditation> by the Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools </wiki/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools>. This
milestone as accompanied by the construction of a university library
that was shared amongst the Atlanta University Center institutions, and
the center continues to share a library to this day.

In 1927, one of the most important buildings on campus, Sisters Chapel,
was dedicated. The chapel was named for its primary benefactors, Laura
Spelman Rockefeller and Lucy Maria Spelman. The college also began to
see an improvement in extracurricular investment in the arts, with the
inauguration of the much-loved Atlanta tradition of the annual
Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol Concert and smaller events such as the
spring orchestra and chorus concert, the Atlanta University Summer
Theater, and the University Players, a drama organization for AUC
students. In 1930 the Spelman Nursery School as created as a training
center for mothers and a practice arena for students who planned careers
in education and child development. Spelman celebrated its 50th
anniversary in April 1931.


    [edit </w/index.php?title=Spelman_College&action=edit&section=3>] Campus

*Packard Hall*, named for one of the founders, Sophia B. Packard
</wiki/Sophia_B._Packard>. Packard was constructed in 1888 to contain
extra residences for on-campus students. It remained a residence hall
until 2003, when it was renovated as an administrative building. The
building now houses the Office of Financial Aid, the Registrar, the
Cashier, the Office of Student Accounts and the Office of Admissions and
Enrollment Management.

*Giles Hall*, named for one of the founders, Harriet E. Giles. Giles
Hall was renovated in 1996 and currently houses the Departments of
Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, Education, Economics, and Art,
as well as the Honors Program and the Learning Resources Center. It is
also known amongst students for its "hellish staircase."

*Morehouse-James Hall* was completed in 1901, named for Henry L.
Morehouse. It serves as a student residence hall. Until 2005 it served
as a residence hall for upper-class students, but due to a large influx
of first-year students that year, it served as a first-year residence hall.

*MacVicar Hall* was completed in 1901 and was originally the nursing
school and clinical training office. It now houses the Women's Health
Center, the Office of Counseling and Disability Serivces, and a small
residence hall for the students who participate in Student Health
Advocates and Peer Educators (SHAPE), a peer health education
organization on campus.

*Reynolds Cottage*, built in 1901 and remodeled in 1996, is the
president's residence.

*Bessie Strong Hall* was constructed in 1917 and was renovated in 2003.
It serves as a student residence for students in the WISDOM (Women In
Spiritual Discernment of Ministry) program, and also houses the Dean of
the chapel's office and prayer rooms. This residence hall was the main
building used for the filming of the television series /A Different
World </wiki/A_Different_World>/.

*Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Building*, completed in 1918, was
originally intended as a facility to train home economics teachers. It
is named after Laura Spelman Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller
</wiki/John_D._Rockefeller>'s wife, who was a primary contributor to
Spelman. It now houses the Marian Wright Edelman Child Development
Center, and also provides a student residence hall. It is typically
referred to as "Laura Spelman" to avoid confusion with the many other
buildings named after Rockefeller's relatives.

*Sisters Chapel*, completed and dedicated in 1927, contains an
auditorium with a seating capacity </wiki/Seating_capacity> of 1,050 and
the Harreld James Organ, a three-manual Holtkamp organ of 53 ranks. This
organ was installed in April 1968. In 1942 the Alumnae Association
donated chimes for the Chapel, and in the fall of 2005 renovations were
completed.

*Read Hall*, built in 1936, contains the gymnasium, the Department of
Physical Education, a swimming pool and bowling alleys and dance
studios. It was named for Spelman's fourth president, Florence Matilda Read.

*Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Hall* (commonly called 'Abby' by students,
after Abby Aldrich Rockefeller </wiki/Abby_Aldrich_Rockefeller>, the
wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. </wiki/John_D._Rockefeller,_Jr.>) was
built in 1952 and serves as a freshman residence hall.

*John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Fine Arts Building* was completed in 1964 and
houses the Departments of Music and Drama.

*Dorothy Shepard Manley Hall*, was completed in 1964 and was named for
Dorothy Manley, wife of President Albert Manley, who contributed heavily
to the decorating of the building. It now serves as a first-year
residence hall.

*Howard-Harreld Hall* was built in 1968 and was named to honor two
alumnae. It now serves as a first-year residence hall.

*Sally Sage McAlpin Hall* serves as an upperclass residence hall and was
named in honor of a former chair of the Board of Trustees.

The *Albert E. Manley College Center* houses the Alma Upshaw Dining
Room, the Lawrence J. MacGregor Board Room, administrative and student
government offices, the snack shop, the commuter student lounge, and two
concourses—Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman. Adjacent are the
bookstore and the mail center.

The *Donald and Isabel Stewart Living-Learning Center* opened in the
fall of 1983. In addition to housing 198 students from all classes, the
building includes a large meeting room and quarters for visiting
lecturers, scholars, and artists.

The *Johnnetta B. Cole Living-Learning Center II* opened September 1,
1989. The Center houses 200 students and provides conference facilities
for on-campus and off-campus organizations, as well as houses the
Offices of Housing and Residential Life and Continuing Education.

The *Camille O. Hanks Cosby Academic Center*, dedicated in February
1996, was made possible by a $20 million grant from Drs. Bill and
Camille Cosby. This building houses the Departments of History, English,
Religion & Philosophy, and Modern Foreign Language. The center also has
a museum, the College Archives, an auditorium, the writing center, the
Women's Research and Resource Center, reading rooms and a foreign
language lab.

The *Albro-Falconer-Manley Science Center* is the newest building on
Spelman's campus, as it was completed in 2000. This building houses the
Departments of Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and
Environmental Science as well as the Dual-Degree Engineering Program and
the Office of Science, Engineering, and Technology Careers. It has a
large auditorium donated by NASA. The "Science Center" also is a general
term used to encompass Tapley Hall and the Academic Computing Center,
both which predate the actual Science Center but are now connected to it
by a series of breezeways.

Spelman also recently acquired the Millgan Building, an administrative
building that previously housed the Atlanta University Center offices
but now houses Spelman's Department of Career Services and the Office of
Institutional Research, Assessment, and Planning. Spelman received a $10
million grant from Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2007 to establish an
international business and global economics program, including a full
service Chinese language program, at the college, and these programs are
expected to be housed in the Milligan Building. It is not, however,
considered "on-campus" as it is outside of Spelman's gate. Spelman also
shares the Robert W. Woodruff </wiki/Robert_W._Woodruff> Library with
the other Atlanta University Center institutions.

Spelman is currently constructing a "green" residence hall behind the
Living-Learning Center I. The as-of-yet unnamed residence hall is
planned to have suite-style accommodations for upper-class students,
including a second dining hall and a parking deck on the ground floor
and is for now referred to as "The Suites". Although the hall is
currently outside of Spelman's gates, plans include extending the gate
to encircle the residence hall. The hall is expected to be finished in
the fall of 2008.

*Other buildings no longer on campus:* Chadwick Hall, originally a
student residence hall (removed in 1986) Morgan Hall, the student center
and dining hall (destroyed by fire in 1970) Upton Hall, an
administrative building (removed in 2004)
