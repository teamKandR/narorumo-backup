_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Places labels in boxes on an existing plot

_U_s_a_g_e:

      boxed.labels(x,y=NA,labels,bg="white",border=TRUE,xpad=1.2,ypad=1.2,
       srt=0,cex=1,adj=0.5,...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     x,y: x and y position of the centers of the labels. 'x' can be an
          'xy.coords' list.

      bg: The fill color of the rectangles on which the labels are
          displayed.

  labels: Text strings

  border: Whether to draw borders around the rectangles.

xpad,ypad: The proportion of the rectangles to the extent of the text
          within.

     srt: Rotation of the labels. If 90 or 270 degrees, the box will be
          rotated 90 degrees.

     cex: Character expansion. See 'text'.

     adj: left/right adjustment. If this is set outside the function,
          the box will not be aligned properly.

     ...: additional arguments passed to 'text'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The label(s) are displayed on a rectangular background. This may
     be useful for visibility. Only right angle rotations are allowed
     in 'boxed.labels'. Important change: 'xpad' and 'ypad' are now the
     full proportion of the box to text, not half. The user can now
     call 'cylindrect' or 'gradient.rect' for the background rectangle.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     nil

_N_o_t_e:

     This function is best for regularly spaced labels where
     overlapping is not a problem. See 'thigmophobe.labels' for placing
     labels  where overlap is likely.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'spread.labels', 'thigmophobe.labels'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

      x<-rnorm(10)
      y<-rnorm(10)
      plot(x,y,type="p")
      nums<-c("one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten")

      # now label a barplot
      xpos<-barplot(c(1,3,2,4))
      boxed.labels(xpos,0.5,nums[1:4])
      # perform a PCA on the "swiss" dataset and plot the first two components
      data(swiss)
      swiss.pca<-prcomp(swiss)
      plot(swiss.pca$rotation[,1:2],xlim=c(-1,0.2),main="PCA of swiss dataset",
       type="n")

       colnames(swiss),bg=c("red","purple","blue","blue","darkgreen","red"),
       col="white")
